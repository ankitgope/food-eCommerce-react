Now in home page 
1 importing the addToCrat
2. we are will dispatch meas we will pass a data throught addToCrat with the help of dispatch
3. in slice we have a reducer in which we have to feed the data to add in the initial state--> which nitially have empty array 
state is as same as initialState

state.cart=[...state.cart,action.payload]
in here we are doing is that we are updating the state in which we will get the prevoiusly present data and then add the recent action data
